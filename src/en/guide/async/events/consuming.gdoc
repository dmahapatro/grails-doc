There are several ways to consume an event. As mentioned previously services and controllers implement the [Events|api:grails.events.Events] trait.

The @Events@ trait provides several methods to register event consumers. For example:

{code}
on("myEvent") {
    println "Event fired!"
}
{code}

Note that if you wish a class (other than a controller or service) to be an event consumer you simply have to implement the @Events@ trait and ensure the class is registered as a Spring bean.
