By default, access to service methods is not synchronised, so nothing prevents concurrent execution of those methods. In fact, because the service is a singleton and may be used concurrently, you should be very careful about storing state in a service. Or take the easy (and better) road and never store state in a service.

You can change this behaviour by placing a service in a particular scope. The supported scopes are:

* @prototype@ - A new service is created every time it is injected into another class
* @request@ - A new service will be created per request
* @flash@ - A new service will be created for the current and next request only
* @flow@ - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the flow
* @conversation@ - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the conversation. ie a root flow and its sub flows
* @session@ - A service is created for the scope of a user session
* @singleton@ (default) - Only one instance of the service ever exists

{note}
If your service is @flash@, @flow@ or @conversation@ scoped it must implement @java.io.Serializable@ and can only be used in the context of a [Web Flow|guide:webflow]
{note}

To enable one of the scopes, add a static scope property to your class whose value is one of the above, for example

{code:java}
static scope = "flow"
{code}
